Project Title


Project Summary:  It should be a 1-2 paragraph description of what your project is.


Description of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you want to solve, etc.?


What would be a good creative component (technically challenging function) that can improve the functionality of your application? (What is something cool that you want to include? How are you planning to achieve it?)


Usefulness. Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful. What are the basic functions of your web application? (What can users of this website do? Which simple and complex features are there?). Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there?  If so, what are they, and how is yours different?


Realness. We want you to build a real application. So, make sure to locate real datasets. Describe your data sources (Where is the data from? In what format [csv, xls, txt,...], data size [cardinality and degree], what information does the data source capture?).  It would be hard to satisfy stage 2 requirements with one dataset. Thus, we strongly recommend identifying at least two different data sources for your project.


A detailed description of the functionality that your website offers. This is where you talk about what the website delivers. Talk about how a user would interact with the application (i.e., things that one could create, delete, update, or search for). Read the requirements for stage 4 to see what other functionalities you want to provide to the users. You should include:


A low-fidelity UI mockup: What do you imagine your final applicationâ€™s interface might look like? A PowerPoint slide or a pencil sketch on a piece of paper works!


Project work distribution: Who will be responsible for each of the tasks or subtasks?


Explain how backend systems will be distributed across members. Be as specific as possible as this could be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.
